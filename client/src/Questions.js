// Explain how to build stateful class components.
    //1. Declare class and extend react component.
    //2. Set up constructor and add state.
    //3. Render UI and return JSX.

// Describe the different phases of the component lifecycle.
    //1. Birth/Mounting Phase - component is being built.
    //2. Growth/Updating Phase - component data is updating.
    //3. Death/Un-mounting Phase - component is removed.

// Demonstrate an understanding of class component lifecycle methods.
    //componentDidMount() can be use to connect a React app to web APIs.
    //The constructor for a React component is called before it is mounted.
    //The render() method is the only required method in a class component.

// Define stateful logic.
    //Any code that uses state.

// Describe how to test a React component with React Testing Library.
    //Import dependencies and methods
    //Arrange test by setting up code to test
    //Act - calling a function or method to return result of interest.
    //Assert if expected  return matched actual return.
